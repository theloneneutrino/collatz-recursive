# Collatz conjecture program
This program implements the collatz conjecture using recursion.  It is probably not the best way of doing this, but that wasn't the point.

This program exists to be a testing grounds for me to figure out a few things I want to know better, such as how to setup manpages and getting better at makefiles.
